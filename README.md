The **Tennis Simulation & Streaming System** is a real-time tennis game simulation engine designed for relaxation and enjoyment. Whether you want to **spectate AI matches**, **challenge a friend**, or **play against AI**, the system offers a seamless and engaging experience. It features **WebSocket-based live streaming**, customizable game rules, and built-in video & audio communication for multiplayer matches.

## **2. Game Mechanics & Internals**  
### **2.1 Highly Configurable Rules**  
Users can tweak multiple parameters to define how their tennis matches are played:  
- **Points to win a game** (Standard, No-Ad, Custom).  
- **Set rules** (Min/max points, tie-break triggers).  
- **Match rules** (Number of sets required to win).  

### **2.2 Internals - How the Simulation Works**  
- The game engine **simulates** an entire match instantly based on predefined AI logic.  
- Results are **stored** in a backend system (file, Redis, or database).  
- Data is **streamed progressively** via WebSockets to simulate real-time play.

## **3. API Endpoints**  
### **3.1 HTTP Endpoints**  
- `POST /start-game` → Start a new match and return a WebSocket URL.  
- `GET /match/{match_id}` → Get match metadata (players, rules, status).  
- `GET /live-matches` → Fetch ongoing AI & player matches.  

### **3.2 WebSocket Endpoints**  
- `ws://server/game/{game_id}` → Stream live game data.  
- `ws://server/chat/{game_id}` → Real-time chat during a match.

pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### **4.2 Running the Frontend**  
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### **4.3 Redis Setup (Optional)**  
If using Redis for storage:  
```bash
